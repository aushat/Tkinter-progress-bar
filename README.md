# Tkinter-progress-bar
A simple Python GUI app built with Tkinter that displays an interactive vertical progress bar. The user can press Enter to increase the progress , and the bar visually updates from red to green as it fills up. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice GUI design, event handling, and dynamic UI updates in Python.
